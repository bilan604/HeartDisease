Class: STA 160
Grade: A+

## Contents of Paper
This paper (click the title to see the PDF) covers a highly optimized model for the predictive identification of heart disease. Comparing the model to a suite of other optimized models, the paper emphasis the importance of selecting the appropriate metric for model evaluation, understanding assumtions and complications in the data such as survivorship bias, and how covariance is handled by different models at a high level. Advantages of bagging, boosting, and unsupervised machine learning models are some of the main topics.

## About This Project
This project was for STA160, the last statistics class at UC Davis, where two projects worth 40% and 60% of your grade are assigned at the begining of the quarter. Having done a Machine Learning Internship at IQVIA already, I knew that the a gradient boosted random forest ensemble would be the most optimal solution available without using a specific neural network library such as Tensorflow. Since I had finished all the modelling before the professor started covering the project, I was invited to present on what I had done for the project (EDA, model metrics) as well as cover the limitations of the Lasso model in it's linear approach to handling covariance.

Originally I was planning to do this project by myself, but I met an old friend David in the class, and after I wrote the paper David provided the introduction and abstract as well as coordinated three other members to join our team. The other members each contributed a figure for the EDA sections.
